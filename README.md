This is a fully responsive sign-up page created as part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## Lessons Learned

This project wasn't too difficult, mostly just applying what I learned about HTML forms. Overall mostly just additional HTML and CSS practice. Enjoyed working on the CSS and styling the page to match the image.
